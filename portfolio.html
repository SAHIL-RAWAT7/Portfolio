            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Sahil Rawat, and I am currently a second-year B.Tech student with a strong passion for both graphic design and front-end development. My academic journey in Computer Science and Engineering has fueled my curiosity for technology, and I’m constantly striving to merge creativity with technical skills. I find immense joy in transforming ideas into visually appealing and user-friendly designs, making the web not just functional, but also enjoyable for users.

                As a graphic designer, I specialize in creating clean and engaging designs that communicate messages effectively. My proficiency in tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma allows me to create logos, marketing materials, and user interfaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I believe that design is not just about making things look good—it's about making sure they work well for the intended audience. From color theory to typography, I enjoy the process of designing visuals that resonate with people.
                
                On the technical side, I’m a front-end developer who loves bringing those designs to life. I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring that the websites I create are fully responsive and optimized for different devices. I enjoy the challenge of balancing form and function, ensuring that the user experience is seamless across various screen sizes. My experience in front-end development includes building websites from scratch, customizing themes, and creating interactive elements that enhance user engagement. Whether it's creating dynamic content, managing responsive layouts, or optimizing site performance, I am always looking for ways to improve the user experience.
                
                Balancing both graphic design and development gives me a unique perspective on building web interfaces. I not only understand how to create visually stunning designs but also have the technical know-how to implement them. My ultimate goal is to continue honing my skills in both areas and become a versatile full-stack developer capable of delivering end-to-end solutions for clients or projects.
                
                When I’m not coding or designing, I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends in technology and design, constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques to enhance my skill set. I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that challenge my creativity and technical abilities.</p>
